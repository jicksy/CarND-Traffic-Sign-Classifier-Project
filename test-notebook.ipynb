    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to shuffle and augment training images by rotating each image by -10 degrees and by zooming by ratio 1.25. The rotated images were appended to the original X_test and y_test list.\n",

    "Number of Training examples after augmenting = 139196\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I decided to increase the training examples is to increase the efficiency of the model as it will have more images to train on.   \n",

    "* To start with I implemented the LeNet-5 architecture that was mentioned in class.\n",

    "* Since the training set accuracy was below 90%, the model was adjusted by including dropout and by adding a regularizer. This was done to reduce overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
